SAM: 
You never did eat your lunch, did you. 

MARION: 
(sitting up)
I better get back to the office. These extended lunch hours give my 
boss excess acid. 

SAM: 
Why don't you call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the 
afternoon off? It's Friday, anyway--and hot. 

Sam sits on the bed. They caress and intermix kisses with conversation.

MARION: 
What do I do with my free afternoon? Walk you to the airport? 

SAM: 
Well, we could laze around here a while longer. 

MARION: 
Checking out time is three P.M.
(They sink down on the bed, facing each other. More kissing and 
caressing.)
Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when 
your time is up-- Oh, Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like 
this! 

SAM: 
I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend an occasional 
night in a cheap hotel. 

MARION: 
When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately. 

SAM: 
You sure talk like a girl who's been married. 

MARION: 
Sam, this is the last time. 

SAM: 
Yeah? For what? 

MARION: 
For this. Meeting you in secret, so--we can be secretive. You come down 
here on business trips--we steal lunch hours and--I wish you wouldn't 
even come! 

SAM: 
All right, what do we do instead? Write each other lurid love letters? 

MARION: 
(rises from the bed and goes to get her clothes)
I have to go, Sam. 

SAM: 
I can come down next week. 

MARION: 
No. 

SAM: 
Not even just to see you? To have lunch--in public? 

MARION: 
(putting on her blouse)
Oh, we can see each other. We can even have dinner--but respectably--in 
my house, with my mother's picture on the mantel, and my sister helping 
me broil a big steak for three. 

SAM: 
(picks up his shirt and sits in a chair)
And after the steak, do we send Sister to the movies? Turn Mama's 
picture to the wall? 

MARION: 
Sam! 

SAM: 
(broadly submissive)
All right.
(Marion stops, turns to face him. He gets up and puts on his shirt.)
Marion, whenever it's possible I want to see you. And under any 
circumstances--even respectability. 

MARION: 
You make respectability sound--disrespectful. 

SAM: 
Oh, no--I'm all for it. It requires patience, temperance--a lot of 
sweating out. Otherwise, though, it's just hard work.
(embracing her)
But if I can see you and touch you even as simply as this--I won't 
mind.
(He walks to the window.)
I'm tired of sweating for people who aren't there. I sweat to pay off 
my father's debts and he's in his grave. I sweat to pay my ex-wife 
alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere. 

MARION: 
I pay too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms. 

SAM: 
A couple of years and my debts will be paid off, and if she ever 
remarries the alimony stops, and-- 

MARION: 
I haven't even been married once yet. 

SAM: 
Yeah, but when you do, you'll swing! 

MARION: 
(embracing him)
Oh Sam, let's get married!
(They kiss.)


SAM: 
Yeah. And live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in 
Fairvale. We'll have lots of laughs. I tell you what. When I send my 
ex-wife alimony you can lick the stamps. 

MARION: 
I'll lick the stamps. 

SAM: 
(He withdraws from the embrace and paces, then goes to the window.)
Marion, you want to cut this off--go out and find yourself somebody 
available? 

MARION: 
(demurely)
I'm thinking of it. 

SAM: 
(self-mockingly)
How could you even think a thing like that! 

MARION: 
(gathering her things)
Don't miss your plane. 

SAM: 
Hey, we can leave together, can't we? 

MARION: 
Hm-mm. I'm late, and uh, you have to put your shoes on.
(She exits.)


Fade from Sam staring at his feet to the interior store front of Lowery 
Real Estate. Marion hurriedly enters the front door.
(Through the picture window, a portly gentleman can be seen standing on 
the sidewalk, his profile passingly familiar.)

MARION: 
(to a young female clerk sitting at a desk)
Is Mr. Lowery back from lunch? 

CAROLINE: 
He's lunching with the man who's buying the Harris Street property. You 
know, the oil lease man? That's why he's late.
(noticing Marion's hand to her forehead)
You got a headache? 

MARION: 
Oh, it'll pass. Headaches are like resolutions--you forget them as soon 
as they stop hurting. 

CAROLINE: 
Have you got some aspirin? 

MARION: 
(sitting at her desk)
No. 

CAROLINE: 
I've got something--not aspirin.
(takes a plastic bottle of pills from her drawer)
My mother's doctor gave them to me the day of my wedding. Teddy was 
furious when he found out I'd taken tranquilizers. 

MARION: 
(applying lipstick)
There any calls? 

CAROLINE: 
Teddy called me; my mother called to see if Teddy called-- Oh, your 
sister called to say she's going to Tucson to do some buying and she'll 
be gone the whole weekend and-- 
Two middle-aged businessmen enter. Lowery is the realtor, conservative 
in appearance. Cassidy is broad and boisterous. He wears a white fedora 
and string tie.

CASSIDY: 
Wow! It's as hot as fresh milk! Say, you girls oughtta get your boss to 
air-condition you up! He can afford it today. 

LOWERY: 
Oh, Marion, will you get the copies of that deed ready for Mr. Cassidy? 

CASSIDY: 
Yeah, tomorrow's the day! My sweet little girl.
(to Marion:)
Oh, no--not you. My daughter. A baby!
(He sits on Marion's desk.)
And tomorrow she stands her sweet self up there and gets married away 
from me.
(taking her picture from his wallet)
Ah--I want you to take a look at my baby. Eighteen years old and she 
never had an unhappy day in any one of those years! 

LOWERY: 
Come on, Tom. My office is air-conditioned. 

CASSIDY: 
(ignoring him)
Do you know what I do about unhappiness? I buy it off. Are uh--are you 
unhappy? 

MARION: 
Not inordinately. 

CASSIDY: 
I'm buying this house for my baby's wedding present. Forty thousand 
dollars, cash! Now that's--that's not buying happiness. That's just 
buying off unhappiness.
(He pulls out a wad of cash and flashes it at Marion.)
I never carry more than I can afford to lose.
(tossing the cash on her desk)
Count 'em! 

CAROLINE: 
I declare! 

CASSIDY: 
(to Marion)
I don't! That's how I get to keep it. 

LOWERY: 
Tom, a cash transaction of this size is most irregular. 

CASSIDY: 
Oh, so what. It's my private money. Now it's yours. 

LOWERY: 
Uh--suppose we put it in the safe. And then Monday morning when you're 
feeling good-- 

CASSIDY: 
Oh, speaking of feeling good, where's that bottle you said was in your 
desk?
(catching himself)
Oh-oh!
(to Marion, laughing)
You know, sometimes I can keep my mouth shut. 
Watching him turn away, Marion relaxes her smile.

CASSIDY: 
Lowery, I am dying of thirstarony!
(He goes into Lowery's office.)


LOWERY: 
(to Marion)
I don't even want it in the office over the weekend. Put it in the safe 
deposit box in the bank and we'll get him to give us a check on Monday 
instead.
(He goes into his office.)


CAROLINE: 
(She gets up, goes over, picks up and fans through the money.)
He was flirting with you. I guess he must have noticed my wedding ring.
(She reluctantly lets Marion take the money from her.)

Marion places the money in an envelope and into her pocketbook. She 
goes to Lowery's office and knocks.

LOWERY: 
Come in. 
The men are sitting across Lowery's desk as Marion enters and hands 
Lowery...

MARION: 
The copies. Uh--Mr. Lowery, if you don't mind, I'd like to go right on 
home after the bank. I have a slight headache. 

CASSIDY: 
You go right on home, because me and your boss are goin' out and get 
ourselves a little drinkin' done.
(to Lowery:)
Right? 

LOWERY: 
Uh--of course.
(to Marion:)
Do you feel ill? 

MARION: 
Just a headache. 

CASSIDY: 
What you need is a weekend in Las Vegas--the playground of the world! 

MARION: 
I'm going to spend this weekend in bed.
(Cassidy's eyebrows rise. To Lowery:)
Thank you.
(She goes out the door and past Caroline to the front entrance.)


CAROLINE: 
Aren't you going to take the pills? They'll knock that headache out. 

MARION: 
Can't buy off unhappiness with pills. Well, I guess I'll go put this 
money in the bank, then go home and sleep it off.
(She exits.)


Fade to Marion's bedroom. 

Marion appears, wearing black undergarments. On the bed lies an 
unsealed envelope. The camera zooms in, revealing the undeposited cash 
within, then pans over to an open, overflowing suitcase sitting beside 
it. 

Marion puts on a dress and finishes packing. She searches her face in 
the mirror, then takes some business papers from a drawer and places 
them in her purse and, with some trepidation, adds the envelope with 
the money. She picks up the suitcase, pulls a coat from the closet, and 
leaves. 

Fade to Marion driving. As we view her face through the windshield of 
the moving car, we can hear some of her thoughts:

SAM'S VOICE: 
Marion, what in the world--what are you doing here? ...Of course I'm 
glad to see you. I always am. ...What is it, Marion? 

Marion pulls to a stop at a busy intersection. Among the pedestrians 
crossing in front of her car appear Lowery and Cassidy. Lowery sees 
her. She and her boss exchange smiles instinctively, before Marion 
realizes her awkward position, and he becomes visibly puzzled. They 
each tensely move on. 

Marion's flight by car is punctuated by the throbbing string rhythm 
reprised from the Main Title sequence. This and all parts of the film's 
background score are played entirely by string instruments--what the 
composer called "black and white sound." 

Marion continues driving till evening, when she begins having 
difficulty keeping her eyes open. 

Black-out to Marion's car parked at the side of the road at morning. A 
state trooper's car passes her, stops and backs up, parking behind her. 
The officer gets out of his car, walks up, and sees Marion stretched 
out, asleep on the front seat. He knocks on the window. Marion sits up 
quickly and is startled to see his looming face and large sunglasses. 
She starts the car.

OFFICER: 
Hold it there!
(Marion turns off the motor and rolls down the window.)
In quite a hurry. 

MARION: 
Yes, I didn't intend to sleep so long. I almost had an accident last 
night--from sleepiness--so I decided to pull over. 

OFFICER: 
You slept here all night? 

MARION: 
Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes open. 

OFFICER: 
There are plenty of motels in this area. You should've--I mean, just to 
be safe... 

MARION: 
I didn't intend to sleep all night. I just pulled over. Have I broken 
any laws? 

OFFICER: 
No, ma'am. 

MARION: 
Then I'm free to go? 

OFFICER: 
Is anything wrong? 

MARION: 
Of course not. Am I acting as if there's something wrong? 

OFFICER: 
Frankly, yes. 

MARION: 
Please--I'd like to go. 

OFFICER: 
Well, is there? 

MARION: 
Is there what? I've told you there's nothing wrong--except that I'm in 
a hurry and you're taking up my time.
(She turns on the engine.)


OFFICER: 
Now, just a moment! Turn your motor off please.
(She does so.)
May I see your license? 

MARION: 
(pause)
Why? 

OFFICER: 
Please. 

He watches as she turns from him, blocking his view of her purse on the 
seat beside her. She carefully removes the valuable envelope and places 
it aside, then takes the license from her wallet and hands it to him. 
He looks at it, walks to the back of her car to check the license 
plate, then returns the card to her. She replaces it in her wallet, and 
with no further exchange between them, the patrolman returns to his 
car. 

Marion pulls away, and the dramatic background music resumes. In her 
rearview mirror she nervously watches the trooper's car following her. 
She is finally relieved to see him turn off onto a side road. 

She comes to a commercial stretch of highway and drives her car into 
the sales lot of a used car dealership. She parks and gets out. The 
salesman pokes his head out the door and says he'll be with her in a 
second. She glances over a few cars for sale, noting the California 
license plates. She then spots a newspaper dispenser. She buys a paper 
and carefully scans the pages. 

The state trooper's vehicle reappears. He sees Marion in the 
dealership, and makes a U-turn, pulling up and parking across the 
street. He gets out and stands, back to his car, watching. 

The salesman comes out and approaches Marion as she walks toward him, 
her attention centered on the newspaper. He is in shirtsleeves and a 
bow tie.

SALESMAN: 
I'm in no mood for trouble. 

MARION: 
(looking up from the paper)
What? 

SALESMAN: 
There's an old saying: First customer of the day is always the most 
trouble. But like I say, I'm in no mood for it, so I'm gonna treat you 
so fair and square that you won't have one human reason to give me-- 

MARION: 
Can I trade my car in and take another? 

SALESMAN: 
Cn'do anything you've a mind to, and bein' a woman, you will.
(indicating her car)
That yours? 

MARION: 
Yes. It's--there's nothing wrong with it. I just-- 

SALESMAN: 
--Sick of the sight of it. Well, why don't you have a look around here 
and see if there's somethin' that strikes your eyes, and meanwhile I'll 
have my mechanic give yours the once over. You want some coffee? I was 
just about-- 

MARION: 
No, thank you. I'm in a hurry. I just want to make a change and--
(She sees the patrolman across the street. They lock eyes for a 
moment.)


SALESMAN: 
One thing people never oughtta be when they're buyin' used cars and 
that's in a hurry. But like I said, it's too nice a day to argue. I'll 
shoot your car in the garage here.
(He goes to get her car.)


With little choice, Marion decides to ignore the patrolman and go about 
selecting a car. The salesman returns and sees her eyeing a sedan.

SALESMAN: 
That's the one I'd've picked for you myself. 

MARION: 
Uh, how much? 

SALESMAN: 
Go ahead and spin it around the block. 

MARION: 
It looks fine. How much would it be with my car? 

SALESMAN: 
You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over? You 
are in a hurry, aren't you! Somebody chasin' you? 

MARION: 
Of course not. Please. 

SALESMAN: 
Well, it's the first time a customer ever high-pressured the salesman! 
Uh-figure roughly--your car plus seven hundred dollars. 

MARION: 
Seven hundred? 

SALESMAN: 
Ah, you always got time to argue money, huh? 

MARION: 
All right. 

SALESMAN: 
(His cheerful manner ceases.)
I take it you can prove that car is yours--I mean, uh--out of state 
license and all. You got your pink slip and-- 

MARION: 
I believe I have the necessary papers. Is there a ladies room? 

SALESMAN: 
In the building. 

He shows her the way. As they are walking, he notices that she turns to 
look back at the patrolman across the street.

SALESMAN: 
(indicating the ladies room)
Over there. 

Marion goes in. At the sink, she takes her automobile certificates from 
her purse, then removes the cash envelope and counts out seven hundred 
dollars. She returns to the waiting salesman, money and papers in hand.

SALESMAN: 
(nervously)
Ah--I think you'd better take it for a trial spin. Don't want any bad 
word of mouth about California Charlie. 

MARION: 
I'd really rather not. Can't we just settle this? 

SALESMAN: 
I uh, might as well be perfectly honest with you, ma'am. It's not that 
I don't trust you, but uh-- 

MARION: 
But what? Is there anything so terribly wrong about making a decision 
and wanting to hurry? Do you think I've stolen my car? 

SALESMAN: 
No ma'am. All right, let's go inside.
(She follows him in.)


The officer, who has been fixedly watching, gets in his car and drives 
across the road, pulling directly into the lot, just as Marion and the 
salesman emerge from the office. Seeing him, she quickly gets in her 
new car and begins to pull out. The garage mechanic yells. She 
screeches to a stop. He brings her suitcase and coat. She opens the 
rear door.

MARION: 
Just put it in here, please. Thank you. 

The patrolman walks up alongside the salesman and mechanic, who are 
watching Marion drive away. 

Once again the heavily punctuated "driving theme" resumes, as again the 
camera fixes itself at the windshield to study her face. The musical 
pulse softens as we hear Marion's thoughts of how the salesman and 
officer might be reacting to her visit.

SALESMAN'S VOICE: 
Heck, Officer, that was the first time I ever saw the customer high-
pressure the salesman! Somebody chasin' her? 

OFFICER'S VOICE: 
I better have a look at those papers, Charlie. 

SALESMAN'S VOICE: 
She look like a wrong one to you? 

OFFICER: 
Acted like one. 

SALESMAN: 
The only funny thing, she paid me seven hundred dollars in cash. 

Cut to view of road ahead, then back to Marion's face.

CAROLINE'S VOICE: 
Yes, Mr. Lowery? 

LOWERY'S VOICE: 
Caroline? Marion still isn't in? 

CAROLINE: 
No, Mr. Lowery. But then, she's always a bit late on Monday mornings. 

LOWERY: 
Buzz me the minute she comes in. 
...Then call her sister if no one's answering at the house. 

CAROLINE: 
I called her sister, Mr. Lowery, where she works--the Music Makers 
Music Store, you know--and she doesn't know where Marion is any more 
than we do. 

LOWERY: 
You'd better run out to the house. She may be unable to answer the 
phone. 

CAROLINE: 
Her sister's going to do that. She's as worried as we are. 

Marion drives on.

LOWERY: 
No, I haven't the faintest idea. As I said, I last saw your sister when 
she left this office on Friday. She said she didn't feel well and 
wanted to leave early. I said she could. That was the last time I saw--
now wait a minute, I did see her sometime later, driving--uh, I think 
you'd better come over here to my office--quick!
Caroline, get Mr. Cassidy for me! 

On the road ahead street lights and automobile headlights come on as 
dusk sets in.

LOWERY: 
...After all, Cassidy, I told you--all that cash! I'm not taking the 
responsibility! Oh, for heaven's sake, a girl works for you for ten 
years, you trust her! ...All right. Yes. You better come over. 

CASSIDY'S VOICE: 
Well, I ain't about to kiss off forty thousand dollars! I'll get it 
back, and if any of it's missing I'll replace it with her fine, soft 
flesh! I'll track her, never you doubt it!
(traces of a smirk in Marion's face)


LOWERY: 
Oh, hold on, Cassidy! I-I still can't believe--It must be some kind of 
mystery. I-I can't-- 

CASSIDY: 
You checked with the bank, no? They never laid eyes on her, no? You 
still trustin'? Hot creepers! She sat there while I dumped it out! 
Hardly even looked at it! Plannin' and--and even flirtin' with me! 

A few raindrops hit the windshield. In no time it turns into a 
downpour. The glare of oncoming headlights is blinding. The windshield 
wipers are of little effect. 

The musical cadence intensifies, underscoring the driving rain, 
Marion's anxiety, and her desperate journey to an uncertain destiny. 

Marion's car, forced to slow down for lack of visibility, approaches a 
neon sign which reads: 

BATES MOTEL

And beneath it, in smaller neon letters: 
VACANCY

She drives up slowly, looking around. The motel is a one-story, L-
shaped structure. A rustic portico runs the length of the front, 
affording sheltered access to each of the twelve units and the office. 

Marion stops the car in front of the office and gets out. The interior 
light is on. She goes in to see, but no one is inside. She walks across 
the front porch and peers around the corner of the building. She sees a 
large old Victorian style house atop a hill. In an upper floor the 
shadow of a female figure moves across a lighted window shade. Marion 
goes to the car and honks. After a few moments, a man is seen hurrying 
down the hill in the rain. He is carrying an unopened umbrella, which 
he starts to open for Marion when he arrives, but they have both 
already attained cover under the porch roof. 

NORMAN: 
I'm sorry. I didn't hear you in all this rain. Go ahead in please. 

He ushers Marion into the office and hurries around to the business 
side of the counter.

NORMAN: 
(Affably)
Dirty night! 

Norman is a lanky young man, darkly good-looking, charmingly bashful 
around Marion. He wears a rumpled sport jacket.

MARION: 
Do you have a vacancy? 

NORMAN: 
(opening the ledger)
Oh, we have twelve vacancies. Twelve cabins--twelve vacancies. They uh-
-they moved away the highway. 

MARION: 
Oh. I thought I'd gotten off the main road. 

NORMAN: 
I knew you must have.
(placing the ledger before her)
Nobody ever stops here anymore unless they've done that. But there's no 
sense dwelling on our losses. We just keep on lighting the lights and 
following the formalities.
(Marion signs the register.)
Your home address--oh, just the town will do. 

MARION: 
(glancing at the newspaper which sticks out of her purse)
Los Angeles. 

Norman reaches to the pegboard on the wall behind him to get a key. His 
hand hesitates along the row of keys, then reaches for...

NORMAN: 
Cabin One.
(handing her the key)
It's closer in case you want anything. It's right next to the office. 

MARION: 
I want to sleep more than anything else. Except maybe food. 

NORMAN: 
Well, there's a big diner about ten miles up the road, just outside of 
Fairvale. 

MARION: 
Am I that close to Fairvale? 

NORMAN: 
Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.
(He retrieves them from the car and takes her into Cabin One next 
door.)
Boy, it's stuffy in here.
(He opens the casement window a few inches.)
Well, the uh--
(patting the bed)
the mattress is soft and--there's hangers in the closet and stationary 
with 'Bates Motel' printed on it, in case you want to make your friends 
back home feel envious--and the uh--
(He reaches through the bathroom door and turns on the light.)
...over there. 

MARION: 
The bathroom. 

NORMAN: 
Yes. Well, uh, i-if you want anything just--just tap on the wall.
(Marion, facing away from him, smiles at his shyness.)
I'll--I'll be in the office. 

MARION: 
(turning to face him)
Thank you, Mr. Bates. 

NORMAN: 
(smiling)
Norman Bates.
(seriously)
You're not really gonna go out again and drive up to the diner, are 
you? 

MARION: 
No. 

NORMAN: 
Well, then, would you do me a favor? Would you have dinner with me? I 
was just about to, myself. You know, nothing special--just sandwiches 
and milk. But I'd like it very much if you'd come up to the house. I-I 
don't set a fancy table but the kitchen's awful homey. 

MARION: 
I'd like to. 

NORMAN: 
All right--uh--you get yourself settled, and--and take off your wet 
shoes--and I'll be back as soon as it's ready.
(He takes the key from the door and hands it to her.)
With my--with my trusty umbrella.
(He self-consciously hurries away.)


Marion begins to unpack some items from the suitcase, but stops as she 
becomes concerned about the money. She extracts the bulging envelope 
from her purse. Holding it in her hand, she looks about for a good 
hiding place. She opens and closes a few drawers. Her attention settles 
on the newspaper sticking out of her purse. She removes the paper and 
opens it, then takes the cash out of the envelope, places two stacks of 
money on top of the paper, and carefully refolds it around them. She 
then places the newspaper in a casual position on the nightstand. 

Through the open window, Marion hears raised voices coming from the 
house. She goes over to listen. We can barely make out the shouted 
words, at first.

WOMAN'S VOICE: 
No! I tell you no! I won't have you bringing strange young girls in 
here for supper--by candlelight, I suppose, in the cheap erotic fashion 
of young men with cheap erotic minds! 

NORMAN: 
Mother, please! 

WOMAN: 
And then what, after supper? Music? Whispers? 

NORMAN: 
Mother, she's just a stranger! She's hungry and it's raining out. 

WOMAN: 
(mocking)
'Mother, she's just a stranger.' As if men don't desire strangers. Ah! 
I refuse to speak of disgusting things, because they disgust me! Do you 
understand, boy? Go on! Go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly 
appetite with my food, or my son! Or do I have to tell her 'cause you 
don't have the guts, boy? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy? 

NORMAN: 
Shut up! Shut up! 

Marion sees Norman come out the front door. She takes a pair of shoes 
from the bag and puts them on, then goes out the door and waits on the 
porch. Norman comes around the corner, carrying a tray.

MARION: 
I've caused you some trouble. 

NORMAN: 
No. Uh--Mother-- m-my mother, uh--what is the phrase?--she isn't quite 
herself today. 

MARION: 
(indicating the tray)
You shouldn't have bothered. I really don't have that much of an 
appetite. 

NORMAN: 
(pause)
Oh, I'm sorry. I wish you could apologize for other people. 

MARION: 
Don't worry about it. But as long as you've fixed the supper, we may as 
well eat it.
(She stands by the open door of her cabin, but Norman hesitates.)


NORMAN: 
It--it might be uh, nicer--and warmer--in the office.
(He goes into his office, smiling, looking for her to follow. Marion 
smiles to herself, then closes her door and follows him.)


MARION: 
(inside)
Well, it stopped raining. 

NORMAN: 
(tray still in hand)
Eating in an office is just--just too officious. I-I have the parlor 
back here. 

MARION: 
All right. 

She follows him to a comfortable room--cozy except for a couple of huge 
stuffed birds perched ominously above the sitting area.

NORMAN: 
Sit down.
(He sets the tray before her. They both sit.)


MARION: 
Thank you. You're very kind. 

NORMAN: 
It's all for you. I'm not hungry. Go ahead.
(delightedly watching her eat)
You--you eat like a bird. 

MARION: 
(nodding to the stuffed birds)
You'd know, of course. 

NORMAN: 
No, not really. Anyway, I hear the expression 'eats like a bird'--is 
really a fals- fals- falsity. Because birds really eat a tremendous 
lot. But I don't really know anything about birds. My hobby is stuffing 
things--you know--taxidermy. And I guess I'd just rather stuff birds 
because I hate the look of beasts when they're stuffed--you know, foxes 
and chimps. Some people even stuff dogs and cats--but, oh, I can't do 
that. I think only birds look well stuffed because--well, because 
they're kind of passive to begin with. 

MARION: 
It's a strange hobby. Curious. 

NORMAN: 
Uncommon, too. 

MARION: 
Oh, I imagine so. 

NORMAN: 
And it's not as expensive as you'd think. It's cheap really. You know--
needles and thread, sawdust. The chemicals are the only thing that cost 
anything. 

MARION: 
A man should have a hobby. 

NORMAN: 
(sitting back)
Well, it's--it's more than a hobby. A hobby's supposed to pass the 
time--not fill it. 

MARION: 
Is your time so empty? 

NORMAN: 
No, uh--well, I run the office, and uh, tend the cabins and grounds, 
and--and do little errands for my mother--the ones she allows I might 
be capable of doing. 

MARION: 
Do you go out with friends? 

NORMAN: 
(pause)
Well, uh--a boy's best friend is his mother.
(Marion tries not to react.)
You've never had an empty moment in your entire life, have you? 

MARION: 
Only my share. 

NORMAN: 
Where are you going?
(when Marion doesn't answer right away...)
I didn't mean to pry. 

MARION: 
Um--I'm looking for a private island. 

NORMAN: 
(leaning forward)
What are you running away from? 

MARION: 
(taken aback)
W-why do you ask that? 

NORMAN: 
(shaking his head, relaxing back into his chair)
No. People never run away from anything. The rain didn't last long, did 
it. You know what I think? I think that we're all in our private traps-
-clamped in them. And none of us can ever get out. We--we scratch and 
claw, but only at the air--only at each other. And for all of it, we 
never budge an inch. 

MARION: 
Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps. 

NORMAN: 
I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore. 

MARION: 
Oh, but you should. You should mind it. 

NORMAN: 
Oh, I do
(laughs)
but I say I don't. 

MARION: 
You know, if anyone ever talked to me the way I heard--the way she 
spoke to you-- 

NORMAN: 
Sometimes--when she talks to me like that--I feel I'd like to go up 
there--and curse her--and-and-and leave her forever! Or at least defy 
her. But I know I can't. She's ill. 

MARION: 
She sounded strong. 

NORMAN: 
No, I mean--ill. She had to raise me all by herself, after my father 
died. I was only five and it must've been quite a strain for her. I 
mean, she didn't have to go to work or anything like that. He left her 
a little money. Anyway, a few years ago Mother met this man, and he 
talked her into building this motel. He could've talked her into 
anything. And when he died too, it was just too great a shock for her. 
And--and the way he died--(laughs)
I guess it's nothing to talk about while you're eating.
(Marion breaks her enthrallment, looks at the food in her hand and 
smiles.)


Anyway, it was just too great a loss for her. She had nothing left. 

MARION: 
Except you. 

NORMAN: 
Well, a son is a poor substitute for a lover. 

MARION: 
Why don't you go away? 

NORMAN: 
To a private island, like you? 

MARION: 
No, not like me. 

NORMAN: 
I couldn't do that. Who'd look after her? She'd be alone up there. The 
fire would go out. It'd be cold and damp like a grave. If you love 
someone, you don't do that to them even if you hate them. You 
understand that I don't hate her--I hate what she's become. I hate the 
illness. 

MARION: 
Wouldn't it be better--if you put her--someplace--? 

NORMAN: 
(Norman's demeanor darkens. He leans forward.)
You mean an institution? A madhouse! People always call a madhouse 
'someplace,' don't they. 'Put her in--someplace.' 

MARION: 
I-I'm sorry. I didn't mean it to sound uncaring. 

NORMAN: 
What do you know about caring. Have you ever seen the inside of one of 
those places? The laughing and the tears--and the cruel eyes studying 
you. My mother there! But she's harmless! Wh-- she's as harmless as one 
of those stuffed birds! 

MARION: 
I am sorry. I only felt--it seems she's hurting you. I meant well.
(Marion is more than a little spooked by his personality 
transformation.)


NORMAN: 
People always mean well! They cluck their thick tongues and shake their 
heads and suggest, oh so very delicately--!
(He sits back. The storm is over. Gently:)
Of course, I've suggested it myself. But I hate to even think about it. 
She needs me. It-it's not as if she were a--a maniac--a raving thing. 
She just goes a little mad sometimes. We all go a little mad sometimes. 
Haven't you? 

MARION: 
(her concern relaxed)
Yes. Sometimes just one time can be enough. Thank you. 

NORMAN: 
'Thank you, Norman.' 

MARION: 
Norman. 

NORMAN: 
Oh, you're not--you're not going back to your room already? 

MARION: 
I'm very tired. And I have a long drive tomorrow--all the way back to 
Phoenix. 

NORMAN: 
Really? 

MARION: 
I stepped into a private trap back there and I'd like to go back and 
try to pull myself out of it before it's too late for me to.
(She stands to go.)


NORMAN: 
Are you sure you wouldn't like to stay just a little while longer? Just 
for talk? 

MARION: 
Oh, I'd like to, but-- 

NORMAN: 
(He raises his hand, smiles and nods understandingly.)
All right.
(He stands to see her out.)
Well, uh, I'll see you in the morning. I'll bring you some breakfast, 
all right? What time? 

MARION: 
(discouragingly)
Very early--dawn. 

NORMAN: 
All right, Miss uh-- 

MARION: 
Crane. 

NORMAN: 
Crane. That's it. 

MARION: 
Good night.
(She leaves.)


Norman goes out to the guest register on the office counter. He takes a 
piece of candy from his pocket and eats it. He slides the book around 
to face him and reads her signature: 'Marie Samuels.' He smiles, then 
goes back into the parlor. 

He walks over to the far wall and stands very still, listening. A 
stuffed pheasant sits in front of him. The owl, wings spread for take 
off, hovers above his head. The lamp lights the owl and Norman's face 
from below. He lifts a framed picture off the wall, revealing a section 
of wallboard torn away and a peephole drilled through the wall of the 
adjoining room. He peers closely into the hole, which provides a view 
of Marion's bathroom, where she is disrobing. 

After a moment, Norman stands away from the wall, turns his head in the 
direction of the house--an indignant expression on his face. Then, with 
determined jaw, he struts out and up toward the house. He storms 
through the front door, but halts at the foot of the staircase, turns 
away, and slinks down the hallway to the kitchen, where he flops into a 
seat at the table. From the distance we watch him sulk. 

In her cabin, Marion, wearing a glossy robe, is seated at the desk with 
pencil, paper, and bankbook. She is calculating the amount of the 
stolen money she spent and must replace. She tears up the slip of paper 
and is about to toss it into the wastebasket, but thinks better of it 
and takes it into the bathroom where she flushes it down the toilet. 
She then closes the door, removes her robe, and steps into the bathtub. 
She draws the shower curtain closed and unwraps a bar of soap. 

She turns on the shower. 

As she is showering, through the translucent shower curtain we see the 
door open. 

A shadow slowly approaches, then a hand swiftly throws open the 
curtain. Marion turns and sees the backlit figure of a woman with a 
large bread knife in her raised hand. Marion screams. 

The woman stabs Marion repeatedly. 

Naked, defenseless, and in shock, Marion screams while trying to ward 
off the assault with her arms. But the attack is relentless. The scene 
is intensified by searing background music that seems to slash and 
scream. 

Abruptly the onslaught ends and the woman exits. Marion silently sinks 
downward against the wall. Her hand reaches forward to grab the shower 
curtain. The hooks pop and snap off the bar as her falling weight tears 
the curtain loose. She lands head first on the tile floor, half her 
body hanging on the tub. 

The water continues to run, as if trying to clean up the blood-streaked 
tub. We are drawn along with the tainted liquid as it swirls down the 
drain. We would follow it down into blackness, but a large glaring eye 
stops us. It is the superimposed, unblinking eye of the slain woman, as 
still as a photograph, except for the droplets from her hair that fall 
past as we pan back, slowly turning our diagonal view upright, to see 
her full face pressed against the bathroom floor. 

The camera leads us out of the bathroom, across the bedroom, past the 
folded newspaper under the lit lamp, to the open window and the house 
beyond. 

We hear a distant cry...

NORMAN: 
Mother! Oh God! Mother! Blood! Blood! 

Moonlight highlights the dispersing rain clouds above, as Norman comes 
running down the hill in panic. He charges into the room and freezes at 
the bathroom door. 

He swings back into the room, knocking a small picture frame off the 
wall with his shoulder, his hand over his mouth in horror. 

He nervously goes to the window, closes it and draws the curtain. Aware 
that he is too shaken to function, he sits on the bed, attempting to 
gain composure. Moving slowly and deliberately, he rises, closes the 
cabin door and turns out the bedroom light. After a moment, he exits 
the cabin and goes to get a mop and bucket from the office, turning off 
the office light as he leaves. He brings them into the cabin and over 
to the bathroom, hesitating at the bathroom doorway. His dark figure is 
framed by the stark white light of the bathroom. The sound of the 
running shower continues. He places the mop and bucket aside and turns 
off the water, then, with visible distaste, takes the fallen shower 
curtain and spreads it out on the bedroom floor. He goes back for 
Marion's body and drags her onto it. 

He washes his bloodstained hands. Then he takes up the mop and cleans 
out the tub. He wipes down the walls and floor with the towel from the 
rack. 

Edging his way around the body, he goes out to Marion's car, gets in, 
and backs it up to the cabin door. He opens the trunk, then goes back 
into the cabin. He carefully wraps the body in the shower curtain where 
it lies, lifts and carries it out to the car, and places it in the 
trunk. 

He returns to the room to retrieve Marion's clothing and belongings. He 
repacks her suitcase and quickly checks the bureau top and drawers. He 
picks up the fallen picture from the floor--a bird print--and rehangs 
it beneath another--a set of two. He checks the bathroom and medicine 
cabinet, then carries everything out with him. Just as he goes through 
the cabin door, a car comes along the highway. The car's headlights 
sweep across Norman in the open door. He nervously places the mop and 
bucket down out of sight till it passes. Then he gathers and places 
Marion's possessions along with the mop and bucket into the trunk with 
her. 

Before closing the trunk, he goes back inside for one last look around 
the room. Seeing the newspaper on the nightstand, he quickly grabs it, 
turns out the bathroom light, and leaves, closing the door. He tosses 
the newspaper in the trunk of the car, closes it and gets behind the 
wheel. 

He drives the car to a secluded, swampy area, gets out, and pushes the 
car into the bog, where it begins to sink. Norman's dark, brooding 
figure stands sentry over the muddy burial. 

But the bubbling sound stops suddenly as the sinking halts, leaving 
part of the roof and trunk visible. The concern on his face turns to a 
smirk as the car resumes its descent, until it is completely gone. 

Fade to black. 

Scene: Sam's hardware store in Fairvale. 

Sam is seated at an old roll top desk in the back of the store, writing 
a letter to Marion. A glimpse of the letter shows us he is softening on 
the prospect of marriage.

WOMAN'S VOICE: 
They tell you what its ingredients are, and how it's guaranteed to 
exterminate every insect in the world, but they do not tell you whether 
or not it's painless.
(The camera reveals a gray-haired woman at the front counter, 
consulting the young attendant over an impending puchase.)
And, I say, insect or man, death should always be painless. 

Through the front door we see a taxicab pull away as a young woman in a 
tweed suit enters the front door. She is carrying a suitcase and a coat 
draped over her arm. She approaches the young attendant.

LILA: 
Sam? 

ATTENDANT: 
Sam! Lady wants to see you. 

SAM: 
(coming out)
Yes, miss? 

LILA: 
I'm Marion's sister. 

SAM: 
Oh, sure--Lila! 

LILA: 
Is Marion here? 

SAM: 
Why, of course not. Is something wrong? 

The register rings. The woman customer leaves.

LILA: 
(puts down suitcase)
She left home on Friday. I was in Tucson over the weekend and I haven't 
heard from her since--not even a phone call.
(pause)
Look, if you two are in this thing together, I don't care--It's none of 
my business--but I want to talk to Marion and I want her to tell me 
it's none of my business! And then I'll go-- 

SAM: 
Bob, run out and get yourself some lunch, will you? 

BOB:
Oh, that's okay, Sam. I brought it with me. 

SAM: 
Run out and eat it!
(Bob exits.)
Now--what thing could we be in together? 

They have not noticed that another man has entered the store. He wears 
a suit, hat, and carries an overcoat. He seems especially attentive to 
the conversation.

LILA: 
(wiping her eyes)
Sorry about the tears. 

SAM: 
Well, is Marion in trouble? What is it? 

THE STRANGER: 
(walking toward them)
Let's all talk about Marion, shall we? 

SAM: 
Who are you, friend? 

THE STRANGER: 
My name is Arbogast, friend. I'm a private investigator.
(shows them his I.D.)
Where is she, Miss Crane? 

LILA: 
I don't know you. 

ARBOGAST: 
Oh, I know you don't, because if you did I wouldn't be able to follow 
you. 

SAM: 
What's your interest in this? 

ARBOGAST: 
(leans back, his elbow on the counter)
Well--forty thousand dollars. 

SAM: 
Forty thousand dollars? 

ARBOGAST: 
That's right. 

SAM: 
(He looks at Lila for a second, then at Arbogast.)
Well one of you better tell me what's going on and tell me fast! I can 
take just so much of this! 

ARBOGAST: 
Now take is easy, friend. Take it easy--you just--your girl friend 
stole forty thousand dollars. 

SAM: 
What're you talking about!
(softer, to Lila:)
What is this? 

LILA: 
She was supposed to bank it on Friday for her boss, and she didn't. And 
no one has seen her since. 

ARBOGAST: 
Someone has seen her. Someone always sees a girl with forty thousand 
dollars. 

LILA: 
Sam, they don't want to prosecute. They just want the money back. Sam, 
if she's here-- 

SAM: 
She isn't!
(and again, gentler)
She isn't. 

ARBOGAST: 
Miss Crane, can I ask you a question? Did you come up here on just a 
hunch and nothing more? 

LILA: 
Not even a hunch. Just hope. 

ARBOGAST: 
Well, with a little checking, I could get to believe you. 

LILA: 
I don't care if you believe me or not!
(to Sam:)
All I want to do is see Marion before she gets in this too deeply.

SAM: 
Did you check in Phoenix? Hospitals? Maybe she had an accident. Or a 
holdup. 

ARBOGAST: 
No, she was seen leaving town in her own car--by her employer, I might 
add. 

SAM: 
I can't believe it.
(to Lila:)
Can you?
(No reaction from Lila.)


ARBOGAST: 
Well, you know we're always quickest to doubt people who have a 
reputation for being honest. I think she's here, Miss Crane--where 
there's a boy friend. Well, she's not back there with the nuts and 
bolts, but she's here, in this town, somewhere. I'll find her. I'll be 
seeing you.
(He leaves.)


A montage of fade-in images show Arbogast at several hotels and motels 
in the area, getting negative responses from proprietors. Norman Bates 
is sitting on the motel's front porch, reading and eating candy from a 
bag, when Arbogast finally arrives there. Norman rises to greet him.

ARBOGAST: 
(getting out of his car)
Good evening. 

NORMAN: 
Evening. 

ARBOGAST: 
I almost drove right past. 

NORMAN: 
I'm always forgetting to turn the sign on, but we do have a vacancy. 
Twelve, in fact. Twelve cabins--twelve vacancies.
(holding forth the bag)
Some candy? 

ARBOGAST: 
No, thanks. Uh, the last two days I've been to so many motels that my 
eyes are bleary with neon, but, you know, this is the first place that 
looks like it's hiding from the world. 

NORMAN: 
Well, I'll tell you the truth. I didn't really forget to turn the sign 
on. It just doesn't seem like any use anymore, you know? 

ARBOGAST: 
Oh? 

NORMAN: 
You see, that used to be the main highway right there. Well--do you 
want to come in and register? 

ARBOGAST: 
No, no. Sit down. I don't want to trouble you. I just want to ask you a 
few questions. 

NORMAN: 
Oh, that's no trouble. Today's linen day. I always change the beds here 
once a week, whether they've been used or not. Hate the smell of 
dampness, don't you? It's such a--I don't know--creepy smell. Come on.
(He leads Arbogast into the office.)
You, uh, you out to buy a motel? 

ARBOGAST: 
No. 

NORMAN: 
(He turns on the desk lamp and takes some linens out of the closet.)
Reason I asked, you said you'd seen so many in the past couple of days, 
I though maybe you uh-- What uh, what was it you wanted to ask? 

ARBOGAST: 
Well, you see, I'm looking for a missing person. My name's Arbogast. 
I'm a private investigator.
(shows his I.D.)


NORMAN: 
Oh? 

ARBOGAST: 
I've been trying to trace a girl that's been missing for--oh, about a 
week now--from Phoenix. It's a private matter--the family wants to 
forgive her. She's not in any trouble. 

NORMAN: 
I didn't think the police went looking for people who aren't in 
trouble. 

ARBOGAST: 
Oh, I'm--I'm not the police. 

NORMAN: 
Oh, you're-- 

ARBOGAST: 
We have reason to believe that she came along this way and may have 
stopped in the area. Did she stop here? 

NORMAN: 
Well, no one's stopped here for a couple of weeks. 

ARBOGAST: 
Would you mind looking at the picture before committing yourself? 

NORMAN: 
(smiling)
Commit myself? You sure talk like a policeman! 

ARBOGAST: 
(laughs)
Well, look at the picture, please. 

NORMAN: 
(takes it and looks)
Uh-uh. 

ARBOGAST: 
Sure? 

NORMAN: 
(hands it back)
Yeah. 

ARBOGAST: 
Well, she may have used an alias. Marion Crane's her real name, but she 
could have registered under a different one. 

NORMAN: 
Well, I'll tell you, I don't even much bother with guests registering 
anymore. You know, one by one you drop the formalities. I shouldn't 
even bother changing the sheets, but--old habits die hard--which 
reminds me--
(He flicks a wall switch. We see the sign: 'BATES MOTEL - VACANCY' 
light up outside.)


ARBOGAST: 
What's that? 

NORMAN: 
It's the light--the sign. 

ARBOGAST: 
Oh. 

NORMAN: 
We had a couple last week said if the thing hadn't been on they would 
have thought this was an old deserted-- 

ARBOGAST: 
(smiling)
Well, you see--and that's exactly my point! You said that nobody'd been 
here for a couple of weeks and there's a couple came by and
(trailing away)
they didn't know that you were open. 

NORMAN: 
(stiffly)
Yeah. 

ARBOGAST: 
Well, as you say, old habits die hard. It's possible this girl could 
have registered under another name. Do you mind if I look at your book? 

NORMAN: 
(very agreeably)
No.
(takes out the register)


ARBOGAST: 
Thank you. Now let's see. Now here's the date somewhere--hmm. 

NORMAN: 
...there's nobody... 

ARBOGAST: 
Let's see now, I have a sample of her handwriting here--oh, yes, here 
we are.
(Norman eats a candy. He tilts his head to look in the book, as we view 
upward from beneath.)
Marie Samuels.
(Norman tilting further to look)
That's an interesting alias. 

NORMAN: 
(tilting all the way over)
Is that her? 

ARBOGAST: 
Yeah. Yeah, I think so. Marie--Marion--Samuels. Her boyfriend's name is 
Sam. 

NORMAN: 
Hmm. 

ARBOGAST: 
Was she in disguise by any chance?
(extending the photo)
Want to check the picture again? 

NORMAN: 
Look, I-I wasn't lying to you, mister. It's just that-- 

ARBOGAST: 
(overlapping)
Oh, I know that. I know you wouldn't lie. 

NORMAN: 
You know, it's tough keeping track of the time around here-- 

ARBOGAST: 
(overlapping)
Oh, I know, I know. 

NORMAN: 
(looks at the picture)
Ohhh, yeah! Well, it-it was raining and uh--her hair was all wet.
(handing the photo back)
I tell you, it's not really a very good picture of her either. 

ARBOGAST: 
No, I guess not. Now, tell me all about her. 

NORMAN: 
Well, uh--she arrived uh--rather late one night and she went straight 
to sleep and uh--left early the next morning. 

ARBOGAST: 
Well, how early? 

NORMAN: 
Oh, ex- very early. 

ARBOGAST: 
Uh-huh. Which morning was that? 

NORMAN: 
Uh--the uh--th-th-th-th-th-th-th-the next morning--Sunday. 

ARBOGAST: 
I see. Uh-huh. Uh, did anyone meet her here? 

NORMAN: 
No. 

ARBOGAST: 
Did she arrive with anyone? 

NORMAN: 
mm-no. 

ARBOGAST: 
Uh-huh. She make any phone calls or--? 

NORMAN: 
No. 

ARBOGAST: 
locally?

NORMAN: 
uh-um. 

ARBOGAST: 
Did you spend the night with her? 

NORMAN: 
(slightly shocked, innocently)
No. 

ARBOGAST: 
Well, then--how would you know that she didn't make any phone calls? 

NORMAN: 
Oh, we ... w-well, she was very tired and uh-- See, I--now I'm starting 
to uh, remember it. I'm making a mental picture of it in my mind. You 
know, if you make a mental picturization of something-- 

ARBOGAST: 
(overlapping)
That's right, that's right. Take your time. 

NORMAN: 
Uh, she was--she was sitting back there--no, no, she was standing back 
there with a sandwich in her hand, and she said uh--she had to go to 
sleep early because she had uh--a long d-d-d-dr-drive uh, ahead of her. 

ARBOGAST: 
Uh-huh. Back where? 

NORMAN: 
Back uh, where she came from. 

ARBOGAST: 
No, no. You said before that she was sitting back-- 

NORMAN: 
Oh, uh-- 

ARBOGAST: 
or standing back there...

NORMAN: 
Yes. B-back in my uh--my parlor there. She was very hungry and I made 
her a sandwich. And then she said uh--that she was tired and she had to 
go uh--back to bed. 

ARBOGAST: 
Oh, I see. How did she pay you? Cash? Check? 

NORMAN: 
Cash. 

ARBOGAST: 
Oh, cash, huh? Uh-huh. And after she left she--didn't come back? 

NORMAN: 
Uh-uh.
(smiles)
Well, why should she? 

ARBOGAST: 
Yeah. 

NORMAN: 
Well, Mr. Arbogast, uh--I guess that's about it, eh? I've got some work 
to do, if you don't mind. 

ARBOGAST: 
Well, to tell you the truth, I do mind. You see, if it doesn't jell, it 
isn't aspic. And this ain't jelling. It's not coming together. 
Something's missing. 

NORMAN: 
(nods understandingly)
Well ... I--I don't know what you ex- could expect me to know. People 
just come and go, you know. 

ARBOGAST: 
That's right. ...She isn't still here, is she? 

NORMAN: 
(laughing)
No. 

ARBOGAST: 
Uh-huh. If I wanted to uh--check the cabins--all twelve of them--I'd 
need a warrant, wouldn't I? 

NORMAN: 
(good naturedly)
Listen, if you don't believe me, come on--come on with me and you can 
help me change beds--okay? 

ARBOGAST: 
(smiling)
Oh--oh--well, no thanks. 

They go outside. Arbogast watches as Norman starts to go in cabin one, 
hesitates, moves on instead. Then Arbogast sees the house around the 
corner, and in the lit window, a figure.

NORMAN: 
(quickly walking over to Arbogast)
Oh, uh--change your mind? ...You know, I think I must have one of those 
faces you just can't help believing. 

ARBOGAST: 
Is anyone at home? 

NORMAN: 
No. 

ARBOGAST: 
Oh, well, there's somebody sitting up in the window. 

NORMAN: 
No- no there isn't. 

ARBOGAST: 
Oh, sure there is. Take a look. 

NORMAN: 
(without looking)
Oh, th-that--that must be my mother. She's--she's an invlad- an 
invalid. Uh--it's practically like living alone. 

ARBOGAST: 
Oh, I see. Now if this girl, Marion Crane, were here, you wouldn't be 
hiding her, would you? 

NORMAN: 
No. 

ARBOGAST: 
Not even if she paid you well? 

NORMAN: 
No.
(laughs)


ARBOGAST: 
Let's just say for the--just for the sake of argument--that she wanted 
you to gallantly protect her--you'd know that you were being used. You 
wouldn't be made a fool of, would you? 

NORMAN: 
But, I'm--I'm not a fool. 

ARBOGAST: 
Well, then-- 

NORMAN: 
And I'm not capable of being fooled! N-not even by a woman! 

ARBOGAST: 
Well, this is not a slur on your manhood. I'm sorry. 

NORMAN: 
No, let's put it this way. She might have fooled me--but she didn't 
fool my mother. 

ARBOGAST: 
Well, then your mother met her! Could I talk to your mother? 

NORMAN: 
No. As--as I told you, she's--she's confined. 

ARBOGAST: 
Yes, but just for a few minutes, that's all. There might be some hint 
that you missed out on. You know, sick old women are usually pretty 
sharp-- 

NORMAN: 
(overlapping)
Uh, mis- mister-- 

ARBOGAST: 
Just a moment. I wouldn't disturb her. 

NORMAN: 
(overlapping)
Mister Arbogast, I--I think I've--I think I've talked to you all I want 
to. 

ARBOGAST: 
Yes, but just for-- 

NORMAN: 
So I think it'd be much better if you left now. Thanks. 

ARBOGAST: 
Uh--All right. All right. You sure would save me a lot of leg work if 
you'd let me talk to her about--(Norman shakes his head)
Would I need a warrant for that, too? 

NORMAN: 
(curtly)
Sure. 

ARBOGAST: 
Uh-huh. All right. Thanks anyway. 

Norman stands on the porch, sheets clutched in front of him, watching 
Arbogast get in his car and drive away. A smile spreads across Norman's 
face. 

Arbogast pulls alongside a telephone booth, goes in and dials.

ARBOGAST: 
Oh, hello, Loomis? This is Arbogast. Is Lila there? Good. Let me talk 
to her please. ...Hello, Lila? Lila, listen, Marion was up here. Yes. 
She spent last Saturday night at the Bates Motel. It's right out here 
on the old highway. I even know what cabin she was in. It was number 
one. ...Well, this young fella that runs the place said that she just 
spent the night--left the next day, and that was it. Mm. ...Uh--no, not 
exactly. Well, I did question him, believe me, but I think I got all 
there was to get. I'll just have to pick up the pieces from here. 
...Well, I tell you. I don't feel uh--entirely satisfied. See this boy 
had a sick old mother. I think she saw Marion and talked to her. ...No. 
No, unfortunately, he wouldn't let me see her. ...Well, I was, but uh--
I think I'll go back to the motel first. ...No--you stay there with 
Loomis. I'll be back in about an hour. ...All right, fine. Listen, I-- 
You'll be happy to know what I think. Uh--I think our friend, Sam 
Loomis, didn't know that Marion was here. Yeah. A

At the motel, we see Norman walking along the portico carrying his 
sheets. He disappears into the shadows just as Arbogast's car pulls in. 
Arbogast parks and walks to the office. He goes inside and calls out to 
Bates but gets no response. He walks into the parlor in back. The 
stuffed owl and raven hover overhead. There is a safe with its door 
ajar, but no contents of note. He looks around some more, then goes 
outside and eyes the house, a dark monolith with a light in an upstairs 
room. 

He walks up the brick steps that cling to the hill and approaches the 
front door. It is unlocked. He removes his hat as he enters quietly. 
The door makes an uncomfortable sound when it closes behind him, 
disturbing the dead silence. He hesitates, looking about, then proceeds 
slowly upstairs. As he climbs, above him a narrow stream of light pours 
onto the hall carpet, from a slowly opening door. The camera places us 
high above the landing, looking down, as Arbogast reaches the top step. 
A woman rushes out of the room and stabs him in the head. He is knocked 
off balance and stumbles back down the stairs in a semi-upright, almost 
comic, backwards trot. We are drawn down with him, focused on his 
startled, bleeding face. The woman follows him down and kneels beside 
his sprawled body. Her knife rises into close view, then disappears 
again and again, as it is plunged down to where the detective lies--
tastefully out of camera range. He lets out one last, loud groan. 

Scene: The hardware store. 

Sam and Lila are restlessly posed--Lila sitting, Sam standing.

SAM: 
Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely sound. Ever notice that, Lila? 

LILA: 
Sam, he said an hour--or less. 

SAM: 
Yeah. It's been three. 

LILA: 
Well, are we just going to sit here and wait? 

SAM: 
He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay? 

LILA: 
(puts out a cigarette and stands)
How far is the old highway? 

SAM: 
You want to go out there, don't you? Bust in on Arbogast and the old 
lady-- 

LILA: 
(overlapping)
Yes, yes! 

SAM: 
--and maybe shake her up? That wouldn't be a wise thing to do. 

(In the original theatrical version, all of the preceding dialogue is 
played at reduced volume, rendering it all but inaudible over the 
residual audience reaction from the previous scene--a shameless, but 
effective, gimmick to play up the audience's screaming. 

A similar reinforcement occurs in the earlier shower scene. There, it 
is the harsh, scream-like strokes of the violins in the background 
score, which augment both Marion's screams and the live chorus from out 
front.)

LILA: 
Patience doesn't run in my family, Sam. I'm going out there! 

SAM: 
Look, Arbogast said-- 

LILA: 
An hour--or less!
(Sam picks up the phone and begins to dial.)
...Well, I'm going! 

SAM: 
(hangs up)
You'll never find it. Stay here. 

LILA: 
Why can't I go with you. 

SAM: 
(putting on a windbreaker)
I don't know. One of us has to be here in case he's on the way. 

LILA: 
What am I supposed to do? Just sit here and wait? 

SAM: 
Yeah. Stay here. 

Long-toothed rakes reach up behind Lila's shadowy outline in the 
darkened store. A breeze from the open door passes through her hair as 
Sam leaves. 

The scene fades to the now familiar sight of a dark figure standing 
watch above a desolate mud pit. Nearby, Sam arrives at the motel in his 
truck and wanders about, calling for Arbogast. The shadowy figure in 
the swamp breaks his frozen stance by turning his head toward the 
sound, but nothing more. 

Fade again to the hardware store interior, where Lila, in total 
silhouette, runs towards us. From her viewpoint, we see Sam enter.

SAM: 
He didn't come back here? 

LILA: 
Sam! 

SAM: 
No Arbogast--no Bates. Only the old lady at home. A sick old lady 
unable to answer the door--or unwilling. 

LILA: 
Where could he have gone? 

SAM: 
Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on. 

LILA: 
Without calling me? 

SAM: 
In a hurry.

LILA: 
Sam, he called when he had nothing--nothing but a dissatisfied feeling. 
Don't you think he'd have called if he had anything at all? 

SAM: 
Yes, I think he would have ...Let's go see Al Chambers. 

LILA: 
Who is he? 

SAM: 
Our deputy sheriff around here. 

LILA: 
All right. Let me get my coat. 

Fade to grizzled Sheriff in bathrobe descending staircase--carrying 
less than a welcoming facial expression. He joins Sam, Lila, and his 
sweet, somewhat frivolous wife, also in a bathrobe--who wait in the 
small living room.

SAM: 
Good evening. Well, I--I don't know where to start--except at the 
beginning. 

LILA: 
Yes. 

SAM: 
This is Lila Crane, from Phoenix. 

LILA: 
How do you do. 

SAM: 
She's been her searching for her sister. There's this private detective 
helping and--well, we got a call from this detective saying that he'd 
traced her to that motel out on the old highway-- 

MRS. CHAMBERS: 
(to the Sheriff)
That must be the Bates Motel. 

SAM: 
He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. 
Bates. 

MRS. CHAMBERS: 
Norman took a wife? 

SAM: 
No, I don't think so. Uh--an old woman. His mother.
(Mrs. Chambers looks puzzled.)
Well, anyway, that was early this evening. We haven't seen or heard 
from him since. 

SHERIFF: 
(to Lila)
Now, your sister's missin' how long? 

LILA: 
Well, she left Phoenix a week ago yesterday--without a trace-- 

SHERIFF: 
How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale? 

SAM: 
They thought she'd be coming to me. 

SHERIFF: 
Left Phoenix under her own steam? 

LILA: 
Yes. 

SHERIFF: 
She's not missin' so much as she's run away. 

SAM: 
That's right. 

SHERIFF: 
From what? 

LILA: 
She stole some money. 

SHERIFF: 
A lot? 

LILA: 
Forty thousand dollars.
(a pitying look from Mrs. Chambers)


SHERIFF: 
And the police haven't been able to-- 

SAM: 
Everyone concerned thought--that if they could get her to give the 
money back--they could avoid involving her with the police. 

SHERIFF: 
Well, that explains the private detective. He traced her to the Bates 
place. What exactly did he say when he called you? 

LILA: 
Well, he said that Marion was there and uh--for one night, and then she 
left. 

SHERIFF: 
With the forty thousand dollars? 

LILA: 
Well, he didn't say anything about they money. It isn't important what 
he said on the phone, is it? He was supposed to come back here and talk 
to us after he talked to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want 
you to do something about! 

SHERIFF: 
(gently, smiling)
Like what? 

LILA: 
I'm sorry if I seem overanxious! It's just that I'm sure there's 
something wrong out there and I have to know what! 

SHERIFF: 
Well, I think there's somethin' wrong, too, Miss. But not the same 
thing. I think what's wrong is your private detective. I think he got 
himself a hot lead as to where your sister was goin'--probably from 
Norman Bates--and called you to keep you still while he took off after 
her and the money. 

LILA: 
No. No, he said he was dissatisfied and he was going back there. 

MRS. CHAMBERS: 
(to her husband)
Why don't you call Norman and let him say just what happened? 

SHERIFF: 
At this hour? 

SAM: 
Well, he was out when I was there just a while ago. If he's back, he 
probably isn't even in bed yet. 

SHERIFF: 
He wasn't out when you were there. He just wasn't answerin' the door in 
the dead of night, like some people do. This fellow lives like a 
hermit. You must remember that bad business out there--about ten years 
ago? 

LILA: 
Please! Call.
(He consents. Mrs. Chambers dials.)


MRS. CHAMBERS: 
Florrie? The Sheriff wants you to connect him with the Bates Motel.
(after a moment, she gives him the phone)


SHERIFF: 
Oh, Norman? Sheriff Chambers. ...Ye- I been just fine, thanks. Listen, 
we got worries here. Yeah. Have you uh, had a feller stop by there 
tonight? ...Well, this one wouldn't be a customer, anyway. He's a 
private detective, name of... 

LILA: 
Arbogast. 

SHERIFF: 
Ar-bo-gast. ...We- Yeah, and after he left? ...No that's--that's okay, 
Norman.
(He hangs up. Addressing Lila and Sam:)
This detective was there and Norman told him about the girl, the 
detective thanked him and he went away. 

LILA: 
--And he didn't come back? --Didn't see the mother? 

SHERIFF: 
Your detective told you he couldn't come right back because he was 
goin' to question Norman Bates' mother. Right? 

LILA: 
Yes. 

SHERIFF: 
Norman Bates' mother has been dead and buried in Greenlawn Cemetery for 
the past ten years. 

MRS. CHAMBERS: 
I helped Norman pick out the dress she was buried in. Periwinkle blue. 

SHERIFF: 
'Tain't only local history, Sam. It's the only case of murder and 
suicide on Fairvale ledgers. Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy she was--
involved with, when she found out he was married. Then took a helpin' 
of the same stuff herself. Strychnine. Ugly way to die. 

MRS. CHAMBERS: 
Norman found them dead together--(whispers)
in bed.
(a nod to Lila)


SAM: 
You mean that old woman I saw sitting in the window out there wasn't 
Bates' mother? 

SHERIFF: 
Now, wait a minute, Sam. Are you sure you saw an old woman? 

SAM: 
Yes! In the house behind the motel! I called and pounded but she just 
ignored me! 

SHERIFF: 
And you want to tell me you saw Norman Bates' mother? 

LILA: 
But it had to be! Because Arbogast said so too! And the young man 
wouldn't let him see her because she was too ill! 

SHERIFF: 
Well ...if the woman up there is Mrs. Bates, ...who's that woman buried 
out in Greenlawn Cemetery? 

Fade from Lila's face to Norman in the motel parlor, placing down the 
phone. He seems to be ruminating, distant, as he stands up and turns 
out the lights. He goes up to the house. He enters and climbs the 
stairs to his mother's bedroom. The camera trails well behind his 
deliberate ascent. As we follow, we hear voices from the room Norman 
has entered. The camera warily approaches and discretely rises high up 
past the bedroom door, listening, till it achieves a totally 
perpendicular bird's eye view of the hallway and staircase, where it 
remains static:

NORMAN: 
(from within the bedroom--both voices barely audible at first)
Well, Mother, I--I'm gonna bring something up... 

MOTHER: 
I am sorry boy, but you do manage to look ludicrous when you give me 
orders. 

NORMAN: 
Please, Mother! 

MOTHER: 
No! I will not hide in the fruit cellar. Ha! You think I'm fruity, huh? 
I'm staying right here. This is my room and no one will drag me out of 
it--least of all my big, bold son! 

NORMAN: 
Now come now, Mother! He came after the girl and now someone will come 
after him! Mother, please! It's just for a few days. Just for a few 
days so they won't find you. 

MOTHER: 
(mocking)
'Just for a few days!' --In that dark, dank fruit cellar! No! You hid 
me there once, boy, and you won't do it again. Not ever again! Now get 
out!
(pause, then quietly, ominously)
I told you to get out, boy. 

NORMAN: 
I'll carry you, Mother. 

MOTHER: 
Norman! What do you think you're doing! Don't you touch me! Don't!
(From overhead we watch Norman carry a frail body out of the bedroom 
and down the stairs.)
Norman! Put me down! Put me down! I can walk on my own--(fade out)


Fade to black. 
Scene: Fairvale Church, morning. From the street, Sam and Lila approach 
the front of the church, where they greet the sheriff and his wife who 
are exiting mass. Both men wear suits. The sheriff carries an overcoat.

SAM: 
Good morning. 

SHERIFF & MRS. CHAMBERS: 
Good morning. 

SAM: 
We thought if you didn't mind, we'd go out to that motel with you. 

MRS. CHAMBERS: 
He's already been. 

SHERIFF: 
I went out before service. 

MRS. CHAMBERS: 
Did you two have breakfast?
(They nod.)


SAM: 
You didn't find anything? 

SHERIFF: 
Nothing.
(guides them away from the people coming out of church)
Let's clear the way here. 

LILA: 
Well, what did he say about my sister? 

SHERIFF: 
Just what he told your detective. She used a fake name. Saw the 
register myself. Saw the whole place, as a matter of fact. That boy is 
alone there. 

LILA: 
No mother? 

SAM: 
You must've seen an illusion, Sam. Now, I know you're not the seein'-
illusions type--but no woman was there and I don't believe in ghosts, 
so there it is. 

LILA: 
(overlapping)
I still feel that there's something-- 

SHERIFF: 
(overlapping)
I can see that you do. I'm sorry I couldn't make you feel better. You 
want to come around to my office, this afternoon and report a missin' 
person and a theft, is what you want to do. The sooner you drop this in 
the lap of the law, that's the sooner you stand a chance of your sister 
bein' picked up. Now, how about that? 

LILA: 
I don't know. 

MRS. CHAMBERS: 
(brightly)
It's Sunday. Come on over to the house and do your reporting around 
dinner time. It'll make it nicer. You too, Sam. 

SAM: 
Thank you. 

Sam and Lila walk away.

SAM: 
Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type. 

LILA: 
No, you're not! 

SAM: 
Well, do you want me to drop you at the hotel or-- 

LILA: 
Sam--I still won't feel satisfied until I go out there. 

SAM: 
Neither will I. Come on. 

Fade to Sam and Lila in truck, Sam driving.

SAM: 
We better decide what we're gonna say or do when we walk in there. 

LILA: 
We're going to register as man and wife. We're going to get shown a 
cabin. And then we're gonna search every inch of the place--inside and 
out. 

Fade to our first daylight view of both motel and house beyond, as Sam 
drives up. Cut to a close up of Norman up in the house, peering from 
behind a window curtain. Then a view of what Norman sees: two 
passengers disembarking from the truck. Cut back to Sam and Lila at the 
office entrance.

SAM: 
I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting. 

LILA: 
Someone's at that window. I just saw the curtain move. 

SAM: 
(leading her around the corner, toward the house)
Come on.
(They are faced with Norman walking toward them. He wears a white 
shirt, sleeves rolled up.)


NORMAN: 
Well? 

SAM: 
I was just coming up to ring for you. 

NORMAN: 
Uh-huh. 'Suppose you want a room. 

SAM: 
We were gonna try to make it straight to San Francisco, but uh--we 
don't like the look of that sky. Looks like a bad day coming up. 

NORMAN: 
Okay. 

He leads them into the office and takes a cabin key from the wall.

NORMAN: 
I'll take you to cabin ten. 

SAM: 
Better sign in first, hadn't we? 

NORMAN: 
No, that's not necessary. 

SAM: 
Uh, my boss is paying for this trip, and--well, it's ninety percent 
business, and he wants practically notarized receipts. I'd better sign 
in and get a receipt. 

Norman accommodates him. Norman has been wearing a plastic smile for 
them.

NORMAN: 
(after Sam signs)
Thank you. I'll get your bags. 

SAM: 
Haven't any. 

NORMAN: 
(pause)
Well, I'll show you the room then. 

SAM: 
First time I've ever seen it happen.
(Norman's smile drops. Pause.)
You check in any other place in this country without bags and you have 
to pay in advance. 

NORMAN: 
(dryly)
Ten dollars. 

Sam pays. Norman finalizes the exchange with a friendly laugh, and is 
about to lead them out.

SAM: 
That receipt? 

Norman gestures an "Oh, yes." As he prepares it, Lila picks up the key 
from the counter.

LILA: 
I'll go on ahead.
(A look from Norman.)


She goes out quickly, and as she passes Cabin One, tests the door and 
finds it unlocked. We hear Norman say, "All right. There's your 
receipt. Now I'll show you the cabin." Sam says, "Don't bother 
yourself. We'll find it." She manages to close the door and walk on 
nonchalantly the very instant the two men emerge. But Norman seems to 
have glimpsed or heard something. He watches suspiciously from the 
doorway as the couple walks down to unit number ten. 

In the cabin:

LILA: 
Sam, we have to go into that cabin and search it, no matter what we're 
afraid of finding or how much it may hurt. 

SAM: 
(He is sitting on the bed.)
I know. Do you think if something happened, it happened there? 

LILA: 
I don't know. But if you had a useless business like this motel, what 
would you need to get out? To get a new business somewhere else? Forty 
thousand dollars? 

SAM: 
How could we prove it? Well, if he opens a motel on the new highway--
say a year from-- 

LILA: 
There must be some proof that exists now! Something that proves he got 
that money away from Marion--somehow! 

SAM: 
What makes you sound so certain? 

LILA: 
Arbogast! He liked me, Sam. Or he felt sorry for me, and he was 
beginning to feel the same way about you. I could tell the last time I 
talked to him on the phone. He wouldn't have gone anywhere or done 
anything without telling us, unless he was stopped! And he was stopped-
-so he must have found out something! 

SAM: 
(pause)
We'll start with Cabin One.
(at the door, just before they exit)
If he sees us, we're just taking the air. 

They go out and walk along the portico. Lila stops in front of Cabin 
One while Sam walks over to the office to see if Norman's around. He 
goes in and calls, "Bates?" No response. He comes out and follows Lila 
into the cabin. They silently search the room, opening drawers and 
looking in the closet. When they have exhausted the small bedroom, Lila 
goes into the bathroom, turning on the light, followed by Sam.

SAM: 
There's no shower curtain. 

Demonstrating 1950's cinematic finesse, the camera allows Sam's broad 
shoulders--as he looks up at the rod full of unemployed shower hooks--
to block the indelicate view of Lila scrutinizing the contents of the 
toilet bowl.

LILA: 
Sam! 

SAM: 
What? 

LILA: 
Look! 

SAM: 
What is it? 

LILA: 
It's a figure!
(She shows him a piece of torn paper.)
It didn't get washed down! Look. Some figure has been added to or 
subtracted from forty thousand! That proves Marion was here! It'd be 
too wild a coincidence-- 

SAM: 
Bates never denied she was here. 

LILA: 
Doesn't that prove he found out about the money? 

SAM: 
(places the piece of paper in his wallet)
What, do we simply ask him where he's hidden it? 

LILA: 
No. But that old woman--whoever she is--she told Arbogast something. I 
want her to tell us the same thing.
(She turns and walks out of the bathroom. Sam grabs her arm.)


SAM: 
You can't go up there! 

LILA: 
Why not? 

SAM: 
Bates. 

LILA: 
Well, let's find him. One of us can keep him occupied while the other 
gets to the old woman. 

SAM: 
You'll never be able to hold him still if he doesn't want to be held. 
And I don't like you going into that house alone, Lila. 

LILA: 
I can handle a sick old woman! 

SAM: 
(pause)
All right. I'll find Bates and keep him occupied.
(He turns out the bathroom light. As they are about to leave the room:)
Wait a minute. If you get anything out of the mother--can you find your 
way back to town? 

LILA: 
Yes, of course. 

SAM: 
Well, if you do get anything--don't stop to tell me. 

They go out. Sam walks toward the office, while Lila goes in the 
opposite direction. As Sam passes the office, Norman unexpectedly 
greets him from just inside the open doorway.

NORMAN: 
You looking for me?
(Lila halts.)


SAM: 
Why, yes, as a matter of fact. The--wife's taking a nap and--
(Norman moves forward as if he would walk outside, but Sam blocks his 
way.)
I never can keep quiet enough for her so I--just thought I'd look you 
up and talk. 

NORMAN: 
Good. You're satisfied with your cabin? 

SAM: 
Oh, it's fine. 

He has edged Norman back into the office. As he follows him inside, he 
signals "okay" to Lila. 

She circles around and emerges from the back corner of the motel, where 
some crates and an old jalopy are stored. Before her, the dark 
silhouette of the Bates residence looms against the bright sky beyond. 
The way up to the house is long and steep. Sections of steps are cut 
into the slope. 

The camera alternates between Lila's eye view of the imposing house and 
front door, and a frontal image of her approach, each succeeding shot--
of both house and Lila--progressively closer. She never takes her eyes 
off the house, pauses only once at the base of the front porch steps, 
then climbs and enters the unlocked door. She proceeds a few paces 
inside the entrance hall, looking around cautiously before walking back 
and quietly closing the huge door. 

In the motel front office:

SAM: 
I've been doing all the talking so far, haven't I. I thought it was the 
people who were alone all the time who did most of the talking when 
they got the chance. Here you are doing all the listening. You are 
alone here, aren't you?
(Norman nods.)
'Drive me crazy. 

NORMAN: 
I think that would be a rather extreme reaction, don't you? 

SAM: 
Just an expression. What I meant was, I'd do just about anything to get 
away, wouldn't you? 

NORMAN: 
No. 

In the house, Lila reaches the top of the staircase. To the left, is a 
closed door. She knocks and calls, "Mrs. Bates." Then she opens the 
door. Lila steps into the room, and into another era. 

A dancing bronze cherub, poised atop a floor pedestal, greets her. 
Heavy draperies frame the tall windows beyond. Wide-striped wallpaper 
surrounds fringed lampshades and baroque furnishings. A floral 
chandelier hangs over the foot of the huge bed. Above the high, 
intricately carved headboard hangs a turn-of-the-century photograph of 
a young woman. There is a washbowl with ornate fixtures, a crystal 
glass and pitcher, and goblet-like soap-holder. A pair of candelabras 
flank the gilt ormolu clock which is centered upon an immense, 
elaborately sculptured fireplace, a doily-adorned, upholstered chair 
nearby. 

Lila opens an armoire, finding it filled with women's clothes. She 
approaches the cluttered dressing table. The camera zooms in forcefully 
on the centerpiece, a large bronze cast of a pair of hands resting on a 
pillow. An embroidery easel stands near the table. 

Lila is startled by the image in the mirror of a figure standing behind 
her. She swings around to see her own reflection bounced from one 
mirror to another. 

The large unmade bed has a depression where someone has recently lain. 
Lila tests the mattress' warmth with her hand. 

In the motel:

SAM: 
I'm not saying you shouldn't be contented here, I'm just doubting that 
you are. I think if you saw a chance to get out from under you would 
unload this place. 

NORMAN: 
This place? This place happens to be my only world. I grew up in that 
house up there. I happen to have had a very happy childhood. My mother 
and I were more than happy. 

Lila is now climbing the stairs to the upper floor. She opens a door to 
a small bedroom--one that seems suited for a child. There is a male 
doll and a toy fire engine on a small shelf. A worn stuffed bunny sits 
on the narrow, rumpled cot. On the phonograph Lila observes a recording 
of Beethoven's "Eroica." From a shelf in a small table, she withdraws a 
book. She turns the binding around searching for a title. Finding none, 
she opens it. The expression on her face teases our imagination.

SAM: 
You look frightened. Have I been saying something frightening? 

NORMAN: 
I don't know what you've been saying. 

SAM: 
I've been talking about your mother, about your motel. How are you 
going to do it? 

NORMAN: 
Do what? 

SAM: 
Buy a new one--in a new town, where you won't have to hide your mother. 

NORMAN: 
Why don't you just get in your car and drive away from here, okay? 

SAM: 
Where will you get the money to do that, Bates, or do you already have 
it socked away? 

NORMAN: 
Shut up! 

SAM: 
--A lot of money--forty thousand dollars.
(Unaware of what Sam is referring to, but shaken nonetheless, Norman 
walks away, into the back parlor. Sam follows.)
I bet your mother knows where the money is and what you did to get it. 
I think she'll us. 

NORMAN: 
(turns to face Sam)
Where's that girl you came here with? Where is she!
(Panicking, he twists around to look out the window, up at the house.)


Lila begins to descend the stairs. 

Norman and Sam are struggling. Norman picks up a vase from the table 
and hits Sam with it, knocking him out, then runs out of the office. 

Lila is reaching the bottom of the main staircase when through the 
window she sees Norman hastily approaching the house. She quickly looks 
around for a place to hide, and runs to the entrance to the cellar, 
under the staircase. Norman enters, looks in her general direction, 
then runs upstairs. Lila cautiously moves away from the alcove, 
glancing back at the cellar door. She does a double take, and decides 
to have a look. 

She goes into the cellar, and quickly finds another door--the one that 
leads to the fruit cellar. She opens it and goes in. 

An old woman is seated in a rocking chair, her back to Lila. A shawl 
drapes the woman's shoulders and her gray hair is tied in a matronly 
bun. A bare light bulb burns above.

LILA: 
Mrs. Bates? 

She reaches forth and touches the woman's shoulder, causing the rocking 
chair to swivel slowly, turning the woman to face Lila. 

The face that appears is that of a rotted corpse. 

Lila screams, swinging back her arm in horror. Her arm strikes the 
hanging bulb, and the remaining scene is lit by strobe flashes as the 
lamp swings back and forth. 

Another woman bursts through the open door, screaming. 

The woman has a manic look on her face and a knife in her raised hand. 

Sam appears at the door and grabs the attacker from behind. 

Lila is not screaming. She is watching in disbelief as, in the ensuing 
struggle, the woman's wig falls off and the dress falls open, revealing 
the face and figure of Norman Bates. 

In Norman's face is a silent cry, in his arched torso a tortured 
struggle, seemingly more to break free of his own horrors, than Sam's 
grip. 

The searing violin sounds of the bathroom killing reprise as we gaze 
back at his mother, whose wrinkled, mummified flesh thinly coats her 
facial bone. In the hollows of her eyes the swinging lamp throws 
shadows that dance against the inside of her skull, and together with 
the skeletal grin, animate the illusion of a mad, mirthful response to 
the scene before her. 

Fade to crowds congregating outside the front of the county courthouse. 
Inside, police, uniformed and plainclothes, are milling near the office 
of the chief of police. In the office, Sheriff Chambers is talking to 
Sam and Lila, who are seated on a bench across from him. Three other 
police officials stand or sit nearby.

SHERIFF: 
Well, if anyone gets any answers it'll be the psychiatrist. Even I 
couldn't get to Norman, and he knows me.
(The psychiatrist enters the room behind him.)
You warm enough, Miss? 

LILA: 
Yes. 

DISTRICT ATTORNEY: 
(to the psychiatrist)
Did he talk to you? 

DR. RICHMOND: 
No. I got the whole story--but not from Norman. I got it--from his 
mother. Norman Bates no longer exists. He only half existed to begin 
with. And now, the other half has taken over--probably for all time. 

LILA: 
Did he kill my sister? 

DR. RICHMOND: 
Yes. --and no. 

DISTRICT ATTORNEY: 
Well, now look, if you're trying to lay some psychiatric groundwork for 
some sort of plea this fellow would like to cop-- 

DR. RICHMOND: 
(laughing)
A psychiatrist doesn't lay the groundwork. He merely tries to explain 
it. 

LILA: 
But my sister is-- 

DR. RICHMOND: 
Yes. Yes, I'm sorry.
(to the Sheriff:)
The private investigator, too.
(to the Chief:)
If you drag that swamp somewhere in the vicinity of the motel, you'll--
uh--have you any unsolved missing persons cases on your books? 

CHIEF OF POLICE: 
Yes. Two. 

DR. RICHMOND: 
Young girls? 

CHIEF OF POLICE: 
Did he confess to--? 

DR. RICHMOND: 
Like I said--the mother...
(Richmond gives the following account to the whole group in the style 
of a lecture.)
Now to understand it the way I understood it, hearing it from the 
mother--that is, from the mother half of Norman's mind--you have to go 
back ten years, to the time when Norman murdered his mother and her 
lover. 

Now he was already dangerously disturbed--had been ever since his 
father died. His mother was a clinging, demanding woman, and for years 
the two of them lived as if there was no one else in the world. Then 
she met a man--and it seemed to Norman that she threw him over for this 
man. Now that pushed him over the line and he killed them both. 

Matricide is probably the most unbearable crime of all--most unbearable 
to the son who commits it. So he had to erase the crime, at least in 
his own mind. He stole her corpse. A weighted coffin was buried. He hid 
the body in the fruit cellar. Even treated it to keep it as well as it 
would keep. And that still wasn't enough. She was there, but she was a 
corpse. 

So he began to think and speak for her--give her half his life, so to 
speak. At times, he could be both personalities, carry on 
conversations. At other times, the mother half took over completely. 
Now he was never all Norman, but he was often only Mother. 

And because he was so pathologically jealous of her, he assumed that 
she was as jealous of him. Therefore, if he felt a strong attraction to 
any other woman, the mother side of him would go wild.
(to Lila:)
When he met your sister, he was touched by her, aroused by her. He 
wanted her. That set off the jealous mother, and Mother killed the 
girl. 

Now after the murder, Norman returned as if from a deep sleep. And like 
a dutiful son, covered up all traces of the crime he was convinced his 
mother had committed. 

SAM: 
Why was he--dressed like that? 

DISTRICT ATTORNEY: 
He's a transvestite. 

DR. RICHMOND: 
Ah--not exactly. A man who dresses in women's clothing in order to 
achieve a sexual change or satisfaction is a transvestite. But in 
Norman's case, he was simply doing everything possible to keep alive 
the illusion of his mother being alive. And when reality came too 
close--when danger or desire threatened that illusion--he dressed up, 
even to a cheap wig he bought. He'd walk about the house, sit in her 
chair, speak in her voice. He tried to be his mother! And, uh--now, he 
is. 

Now that's what I meant when I said I got the story from the mother. 
You see, when the mind houses two personalities, there's always a 
conflict, a battle. In Norman's case, the battle is over--and the 
dominant personality has won. 

SHERIFF: 
And the forty thousand dollars--who got that? 

DR. RICHMOND: 
(taking out a cigarette)
The swamp. These were crimes of passion, not profit. 

A police guard enters carrying a wool blanket.

GUARD: 
(to the Chief of Police)
He feels a little chill. Can I bring him this blanket?
(The Chief looks to the psychiatrist.)


DR. RICHMOND: 
Oh, sure.
(lighting up)


CHIEF OF POLICE: 
All right. 

We leave the office and follow the guard down the corridor past a 
newspaperman talking to an officer, and watch as another police guard 
standing by a door opens it, allowing the first guard to deliver the 
blanket. Just before he emerges, a frail "Thank you" comes from within. 
The other guard closes the door. 

Scene: 

Norman is sitting alone in a straight-backed chair against a bare wall, 
the blanket draped around his shoulders. We are drawn closer as we hear 
the voice of his mother, generated inside his head.

MOTHER'S VOICE: 
It's sad when a mother has to speak the words that condemn her own son. 

But I couldn't allow them to believe that I would commit murder. 
They'll put him away now as I should have years ago. He was always bad, 
and in the end he intended to tell them I killed those girls and that 
man. 

As if I could do anything except just sit and stare--like one of his 
stuffed birds. Well, they know I can't move a finger. And I won't. I'll 
just sit here and be quiet, just in case they do suspect me. 

They're probably watching me. Well, let them. Let them see what kind of 
person I am. 

A fly has landed upon his hand, which rests in his lap.

I'm not even going to swat that fly. I hope they are watching. They'll 
see. They'll see, and they'll know, and they'll say...
(as he slowly raises his eyes to meet ours, smirking)
'Why, she wouldn't even harm a fly!' 

Is it our imagination, or does Norman's smile begin to morph into his 
mother's dead grin, as we fade to the final shot of Marion's car being 
hauled from the quicksand?
